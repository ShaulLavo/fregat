# Editor

Text editing of workspace files with tabs, dirty state, save, undo, and language-server features.

## Sub-features

Open, edit, save (`Control+s`), auto-save modes, undo/redo, multiple tabs, dirty-close dialog, conflict toast when the file changes on disk, cursor breadcrumbs, minimap.

## How to get to it (user POV)

Open the command palette (`Control+Shift+P`), type a file name, press Enter. Or click a file in the tree.

## Driving it with agent:browser

`scenario editor-type-burst`, `scenario editor-large-paste`, `scenario editor-fast-scroll`, `scenario editor-caret-burst`. These open `--file` (default `use-events.ts`) through the palette. For a save, press `Control+s` in a scenario and check the file on disk plus `bun run logs --action fs.write`.

## Gotchas

Click `.editor-virtualized-viewport`, not the hidden textarea; the viewport intercepts pointer events. The typing scenario leaves the buffer dirty; it undoes but does not save. A conflict toast appears if another process writes the open file during the run.

`renders editor-caret-burst` isolates 300 arrow-key moves without changing text. Compare the `ready` and `moved` snapshots in `render-steps.json`; setup renders are not caret-driven renders. Use `renders editor-type-burst` separately for document-change subscriptions. Each step snapshot is cumulative.
